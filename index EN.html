        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The National Institute of Apopa was founded on February 7, 1981, at the Vicente Acosta School, starting with a single academic high school section and 44 students. Under the direction of Professor José Jerónimo Yánez and with a small team of teachers and administrative staff, the institution began its growth. In 1984, it acquired its own land, which allowed for the gradual expansion of facilities and the educational offer, including commercial and health high schools in 1988.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, the institute has stood out for its prestige and national recognition, with comprehensive attention to students in academic, artistic, sports, and cultural areas. Today, it has 68 teachers, 26 administrative staff, and serves 1,681 students, offering various modalities of technical and general high schools. Since 2015, the institute has developed a Renewed Curriculum: Offering Vocational Technical High School in Administrative Accounting, Primary Health Care, Electronics, Software Development, and General High School.
